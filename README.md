This app is for exploring the trees of Buffalo, NY. Thanks to Mayor Byron W. Brown's [OpenData Buffalo](https://data.buffalony.gov/) initiative, we have the latest info including species, size, and location of 75,265 trees.

Select a tree on the map to learn more, and to post your own notes and corrections. Pick a species from the top menu, and press &#x1f4cc; to save it for easy re-selection. Mark your favorite trees by selecting them then pressing &#x2606;.

This app's data is available via an [open api](https://bflotrees.mandelics.com/trees/api.html).
